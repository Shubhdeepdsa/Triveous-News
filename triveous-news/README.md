# Triveous News  

## Overview

This project aims to develop a News app using Next.js, a React framework for server-side rendering, with Firebase for authentication and data storage. The app will allow users to create accounts, log in, view the latest news articles, read full article details, mark articles as favorites, and provide offline support for previously fetched articles.

## Project Timeline

The project will be executed using an Agile development approach, with a one-day timeframe for completion. The development tasks have been organized into a single sprint.

## Sprint Details

### Sprint 1 (1 day)

- Set up the Next.js project and integrate Firebase for user authentication.

- Implement login and registration pages for user account management.

- Integrate the open-source news API to fetch the latest news articles.

- Display news articles in a list view for users.

- Implement the news detail view with a full-screen display of the article content.

- Allow users to mark articles as favorites and store their preferences in Firebase.

- Implement state management using React Context or Redux.

## Testing and Deployment

Thorough testing will be conducted throughout the development process to identify and fix any bugs. A bug-fixing period is included in the sprint timeline. After successful testing, the app will be deployed to a suitable hosting platform.

## Risks and Mitigation

Given the tight timeframe, potential risks include:

- **Scope Creep**: To mitigate this risk, the team will adhere strictly to the planned features and focus only on the essential functionality.

- **Technical Challenges**: Rapid communication among team members will be encouraged to address any technical issues promptly.

- **Time Constraints**: Continuous progress tracking will help identify any potential delays, and adjustments will be made accordingly.

## Conclusion

By following the Agile methodology, we aim to deliver a functional News app with the core features within the one-day timeframe. Collaboration, efficient development, and a focus on essential functionalities will be key to the success of this project.
